Clabo is DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) which gives you the easiest way to create 
[bot for Telegram messenger](https://core.telegram.org/bots).  

## Usage
If you use Gradle, you should add the follow config
```gradle
repositories {
    jcenter()
}
dependencies {
    compile('org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8', //probably, you have the kotlin stdlib dependency
            'com.github.ivan_osipov:clabo:0.0.1', //the clabo dependency
            'ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.2.3', //any implementation of logging for slf4j
            'ch.qos.logback:logback-core:1.2.3')
}

```

The easiest sample of bot that you can implement below. You should change 'apiKey' with your value
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    bot("apiKey") longPooling {
        onStart { command ->
            command.message answer "Hi, ${command.message.from}"
        }
    }
}
```

## The Main Idea
I believe automatization moves the world forward. I believe that a business which really helps people at same time does 
them happier. I see that support teams, shops and different services which work with bots really simplify life of them
 customers and I want to see the same 
convenient customer service everywhere and this project is my contribution in shared interest.

## Author
Clabo is developed by [Ivan Osipov](https://github.com/ivan-osipov) as free and open source project.

## Kotlin and Java
Kotlin gives us ability for making projects which will be started on JRE 6. Sometimes there are limitations 
for launching applications in JRE 8 in production. This project is compiled for JRE 6 and compatible with higher versions as result.
